stars for having guided me towards developing a protocol for TBI to benefit everyone! </b> </p><p>Little did I know that, years later, my protocol would help my own daughter in so many ways.  After having fallen on her head, she cried a little, rubbed her head and got up and continued to play with her cousins again. That evening, despite my intention of applying magnets on her to avoid possible acute issues, she was too busy and entertained by her cousins to let me interrupt her for an hour and place magnets.  The next day, she was apparently fine and we went out all day and I suspected that perhaps the fall had not been so bad.  </p><p>However, <b> the following morning (36 hours later) immediately after breakfast, she suffered from extreme nausea and vomiting, malaise and lethargy.</b>  Unfortunately we had to fly to another city early morning and so I had no time to apply Biomagnetism on her.  After arriving to our final destination, she was green / pale in color and I questioned if I should take her to the hospital for analysis including a CAT scan of her brain.  Fortunately, I figured at a minimum I should apply the therapy and place magnets on her to see if I could help her snap out of such debilitating symptoms. If she didn’t improve then I was going to take her to the hospital.  I did a 1 hour Biomagnetism session on her, she got up walked around and stated that although she felt much better, she still felt a little dizzy.</p><p>I had her lay down for another session and started all over again and completed a second session of Biomagnetism because I realized that she was making progress and that I should continue to see if I could help her recover even more. <b> After completing the second session, I asked her to stand up and walk around and as she did, she looked normal again and mentioned that she felt perfectly fine. She no longer felt dizzy, weak or nauseas anymore!  Just to make sure and test her out, I had her do several jumping jacks which she did with flying colors and 2 hrs prior couldn’t even stand up straight at all. She then proceeded to have a bowl of chicken and vegetable soup and felt even better afterwards</b>. </p><p><b>The next day, she felt completely normal and I did one more BM session and this time did not find any more left over pH imbalances in her head from the TBI like I had the night before</b>. This is just one of the hundreds of successful experiences that I have had with TBI’s over the last 11 years. </p><br><p><b font-size:120%;'>How to apply Biomagnetic Therapy after a

From hearing <span><strong>Dr. Goiz </strong></span>  express this theory for the first time over 10 years ago to witnessing these effects in children with growth issues, the results have been amazing!  The current interpretation of what happens is that by using the magnets, the pH of the pituitary gland is restored back to normal homeostasis and the body can then continue to work optimally.  The same way that vitamins and minerals can help sustain normal metabolism and support a healthy immune system, the magnets provide a more stable pH environment for the glands and organs of our bodies to also sustain normal metabolism.  <br><br> For pH balancing the pituitary gland, place the Black side of a powerful Neodymium magnet directly over and facing the pituitary gland which lies in the middle of the forehead (On the “3rd eye”) and place another corresponding opposite magnet pair Red towards the Brainstem in the back of the head (approximately 1 inch above the hairline).  According to where you find yourself around the world (Latitude) leave this pair on for the recommended number of minutes as found in the guidelines menu tab in our Beyond Biomag 3D app.<br><br><p class='text-md-center text-xs-center'> <img src='/images/biomagnetism-children-ph-balance.png' class='text-md-center text-xs-center' style='text-align: center; margin: auto;width: 100%'></p><br><br><p> In children, various environmental stressors such as their emotions, nutrition, infections and others can cause for the pituitary gland to function less optimally and therefore produce less growth hormone.  <span><strong>When magnets are properly used in Biomagnetism, they may help restore homeostasis to the body and optimize children’s metabolism back to normal levels.  </strong></span><br><br> This may all happen synergistically when a healthy and balanced alkaline nutrition is maintained and other changes are achieved to bring their bodies into an optimal metabolic state.  If a parent wants a child to grow more, they must help them meet minimum nutritional levels of necessary vitamins, minerals, and amino acids to fulfill those metabolic demands.  A diet that consists of mainly junk, fast or processed foods will <span><strong>cause inflammation to the gastrointestinal tract </span></strong>and limit appropriate absorption. This will of course also lack many key nutrients, thereby limiting normal growth, immune system and metabolism among other body systems.  Few foods can beat the nutritional value of organic fruits, vegetables and a healthy organic vegetarian based diet to provide the correct balance of the essential nutrients.  Non-organic foods tend to be loaded with chemicals from the insecticides, pesticides and fertilizers that are not meant for our bodies, but rather meant for preventing and treating insects and mold and other conditions.  I am not saying that we must all become vegans, <span><strong>but how healthy is a cheeseburger or a beef hotdog versus a mixed salad with either beans or grilled organic chicken or vegetables? </strong></span></p></p><br><br><p class='text-md-center text-xs-center'> <img src='/images/biomagnetism-children-vegetables-balance.png' class='text-md-center text-xs-center' style='text-align: center; margin: auto; width: 100%'></p><br><br> Amongst the many other possible benefits of Biomagnetism for children may be an increased appetite, improved sleep, improved behavior such as better attention and reduction of tics, improved or prevention of sore throats, sinus issues, respiratory infections, chronic ear infections, urinary tract infections, skin rashes, acne, diarrhea, other gastrointestinal issues and many other improvements!  In my experience, children tend to improve faster than adults because they have not been dealing with certain health complaints for as long as adults have. The longer someone is dealing with an issue, the more inflammation and the more off balance the organ or system becomes.  Therefore, more Biomagnetism sessions are needed in adults to restore health, while in children fewer sessions would be required.  By applying Biomagnetism appropriately, the pH balance of the body may be restored to allow the body to recover normal structure and function in addition to proper nutrition.

                "fullDescription": "<p>Ever wonder how dairy products affect our bodies?  It turns out that through Bioenergy and Biomagnetism, we have gained a pretty good idea of where and how dairy products are causing pH imbalance issues and negatively affecting our health. Let’s begin answering one of the most basic questions: <b>What is the original purpose of cow milk? </b>Answer: It is to feed a baby calf of 65 pounds and turn it into a 400 plus pound animal in just a few months.  </p><br><p class='multi-pathogen-image'><img src='/images/biomagnetism-and-dairy-products-1.png' class='blog-detailsImg-diabetes' style='width: 100%'></p><br><p>Human breast milk is for humans and cow’s milk is for baby calves.   Cow milk has a different and specific content of animal protein and fat.  We know that all mammals produce milk to feed their offspring. It is rich, nutritious and really healthy for their species development and growth.  This form of nutrition has evolved in mammals for over 200 million years. These hormonal protein and fat rich fluids are also equally beneficial for hundreds of species of <b>bacteria, virus and fungus</b> that also <b>THRIVE</b> on milk and its <b>post-pasteurization byproducts.</b>  It doesn’t matter if the final product is made with or contains: raw milk, whole milk, skim milk, lactose free milk, organic milk, cream, half n half, yogurt, kefir, goat milk, cow milk, camel milk, cheese or other dairy products, because these different dairy products can also feed hundreds of these opportunistic species. These species are harmful to humans.</p><br><p class='multi-pathogen-image'><img src='/images/biomagnetism-and-dairy-products-2.png' width='100%' class='blog-detailsImg-diabetes' style=''></p><br><p>It turns out that each one of these pathogens has a specific hiding place in our bodies where they take up residence and can cause inflammation.  It is a well-known fact that dairy products become contaminated with a very long list of different infections including:</p><br><p class='multi-pathogen-image'><img src='/images/biomagnetism-and-dairy- products-3.png' class='blog-detailsImg-diabetes' style='width: 100%'></p><p><b>ACCORDING TO THE CDC, FOODBORNE ILLNESSES CAUSE UP TO 48 MILLION INFECTIONS PER YEAR IN THE UNITED STATES ALONE.</b></p><p>Let’s take for example Bovine Leukemia virus, which has been found frequently in dairy cows and in their milk.  In a 2007 study of dairy operations in the United States, over 80% of the cows tested positive for Bovine Leukemia Virus (BLV).  This virus has been identified as the causative agent of Bovine leukemia which is the most common fatal cancer of dairy cattle causing them bovine mammary cancer. Researchers then carried studies to identify if dairy infected with BLV could infect humans.  <b>Recent studies have shown that humans do in fact show antibodies to the BLV.</b>  Results evidenced that <b>74% </b>of the participants in the study had antibodies to BLV, due to prior exposure to this dairy virus.  Why then, has there not been an explosion of bovine mammary cancer due to the high infection rate with BLV?  The answer is simple: as cows are generally slaughtered and sold as hamburger meat before the age of 7 when their potential life span is about 30 years, hence it may be too short a time for bovine mammary cancer to ever manifest.  In 2014, it was discovered that BLV was found in <b>44% </b>of samples of human breast tissue proving that humans can be infected with it and that it can in fact be found in human breast tissue.</p><br><p class='multi-pathogen-image'><img src='/images/biomagnetism-and-dairy-products-4.png' class='blog-detailsImg-diabetes' style='width: 100%'></p><br><p>Therefore, a new study was undertaken to determine if BLV was found in patients with breast cancer.  In  2015, a different study demonstrated the presence of BLV in <b>37%</b> of human breast cancer cases.  Yes, that’s right, the number one cause of cow mammary gland cancer, BLV has also been found in <b><u>37% of human breast cancer cases!</u></b>  Why only in 1/3 of all breast cancers?  Perhaps BLV is like Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) which has been proven to cause Cervical cancer, yet everyone that tests positive to HPV will not necessarily develop cervical cancer. More studies are necessary to understand and clarify this further, but so far, there is a very strong correlation with BLV and human breast cancer.  In a recent 2017 Australian study, it was concluded, &quot Bovine leukemia virus is significantly associated with breast cancer in a population of Australian women and was present in some breast tissues 3–10 years before the cancer was diagnosed. &quot This is just one example of a single infection related to dairy products.</p><br><p class='multi-pathogen-image'><img src='/images/biomagnetism-and-dairy-products-5.png' class='blog-detailsImg-diabetes' style='width: 100%'></p><br><p><b>ACCORDING TO THE <span style='font-size: 20px;'>WORLD CANCER FUND</span> AND A RECENT 2017 SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MILK AND PROSTATE CANCER, CLINICAL STUDIES DO INDEED INDICATE AN ASSOCIATION BETWEEN DAIRY CONSUMPTION AND THE RISK OF PROSTATE CANCER</b></p><p>For those of you that have been drinking/eating dairy and are now thinking, what infections/ inflammations do I have?  The answer is that if you go dairy free for several months or even years, this will help to simply starve out these infections and finally allow the gut and other affected areas to heal optimally.  It is BEST to not get infected in the first place and AVOID or significantly limit its consumption (because of its inherent vulnerability) or simply consume dairy alternatives such as almond, cashew, coconut milk and others. It is better to be safe than sorry.  We should base our diets on a variety of fresh, whole foods, preferably 80% alkaline and 20% acidic.<br><br>Biomagnetism can identify many of these dairy pathogens and the different organs and areas that they are affecting and aid the body in reestablishing optimal pH balance and health. Many of the Biomagnetism pairs to some of these pathogens can be found in the Beyond Biomag 3D App.</p><br><p><b>References:</b></p><p><a href='https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3882853/' target='_blank'>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3882853/</a></p><p><a href='https://www.cdc.gov/foodsafety/foodborne-germs.html' target='_blank'>https://www.cdc.gov/foodsafety/foodborne-germs.html</a></p><p><a href='https://www.wcrf.org/int/blog/articles/2017/05/milk-and-prostate-cancer-how-are-they-linked' target='_blank'>https://www.wcrf.org/int/blog/articles/2017/05/milk-and-prostate-cancer-how-are-they-linked</a></p><p><a href='http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0134304' target='_blank'>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0134304</a></p><p><a href='http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0179367' target='_blank'>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0179367</a></p><p><a href='https://www.wcrf.org/int/blog/articles/2017/05/milk-and-prostate-cancer-how-are-they-linked' target='_blank'>https://www.wcrf.org/int/blog/articles/2017/05/milk-and-prostate-cancer-how-are-they-linked</a></p><p><a href='https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28187509' target='_blank'>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28187509</a></p><p><a href='https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5400803/' target='_blank'>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5400803/</a></p><p><a href='https://sites.psu.edu/breastcancerawarenesshub/2016/09/14/188/comment-page-1/' target='_blank'>https://sites.psu.edu/breastcancerawarenesshub/2016/09/14/188/comment-page-1/</a></p><p><a href='https://images.google.com/' target='_blank'>https://images.google.com/</a></p>",

Those health professionals (Chiropractors, osteopaths, physical therapists, veterinarians, medical doctors, etc...) that already have a solid background in anatomy, physiology, biology and other areas of health, perhaps may learn some basics a little faster. However, it is such a new and revolutionary concept and modality that most health professionals will have to re-study these topics to be able to dominate them with this therapy.<br><br>Anyone who wants to enjoy optimum health and apply this therapy to his/her family as well as to help others heal themselves is the perfect candidate to learn Biomagnetism. As in any other profession, becoming a master takes time, practice, patience, study and requires good intentions.  In the same way that anyone can learn and practice playing the piano, anyone can learn Biomagnetism therapy.<br><br>The most important question to ask yourself is, <span><strong>'How good do you want to become?'</strong></span> Just like anyone can learn to play the Happy Birthday or Yankee Doodle song on the piano, anyone can learn to place magnets on the body.  However, do you want to just stop there, or do you want to learn to play more difficult songs on the piano or even learn to write piano music?  The same applies with Biomagnetism Therapy. Do you want to learn to address difficult client cases or even learn how to discover new personalized pairs?  If you have enough of a passion, open mind, and desire to learn and help others, then you can become a very skilled Biomagnetism practitioner. Students of Biomagnetism are encouraged to continue their studies of the many different subjects encountered at their own rate. To become more proficient and skilled, it is recommended that you continue your training by attending additional seminars over time.  This will keep your knowledge base updated with the most current information as well as reviewing your basic training principles and techniques and providing you with an on-going network and support of fellow practitioners.<br><br>Biomagnetism is compatible with all other therapies and treatments such as conventional, medical and pharmacological treatments as well as natural therapies such as acupuncture, chiropractic, homeopathy, naturopathy, and others.  Adding it to your repertoire of modalities offered can be very beneficial for all involved.  Hundreds of allopathic doctors around the world are already using this powerful technique in their medical offices and clinics to complement and enhance their medical treatments.

                "fullDescription": "<p>Yes, the two modalities are completely different. Even though both the therapies involved in the placing of magnets on the body, Biomagnetism uses two magnets of opposite charges placed in very specific pair combinations on the body whereas Magnetic Therapy is applied by practitioners with usually only one magnet placing in one direction or polarity based upon two guiding concepts: 1) South Pole side acts as analgesic and 2) North Pole side acts as anti-inflammatory. The magnetic fields used for this purpose are mostly of low intensity (between 100 to 500 gauss) and are applied for longer periods of time, hours or days, in areas that show specific symptoms such as pain, inflammation or other.</p>In every magnet, there is a North Pole (South-seeking) and a South Pole (North-seeking) side. The South Pole provides a right-handed (Clockwise) spin to electron flow and has been attributed to an increase in blood flow, fluid retention, and increased pH acidity. The North Pole provides a left-handed (Counter-clockwise) spin to electron flow which can result in sedative effects, reduction of pain and inflammation and has an alkalinizing effect.<br><br><p class='multi-pathogen-image'><img src='/images/biomagnetism-and-magnetic-therapy-are-they-different-therapies.png' class='text-md-center text-xs-center blog-detailsImg' style='text-align: center;margin: auto; width: 100%;'></p><br><p>By using two magnets in Biomagnetism or Biomagnetic Pair Therapy discovered by Dr. Isaac Goiz Duran, the magnets create a very specific movement of hydrogen protons throughout the body which will either attract protons to a given area or repel and push away protons from an area.  This physical property is what allows for such radical pH changes to occur in the body.  Biomagnetism has become a revolutionary, scientific and therapeutic approach to wellness that differs from traditional medicine, homeopathy, herbs and natural therapies.  It is perfectly compatible with any other traditional or alternative modality.  It is an internationally practiced health approach that strives to attain bio-magnetic energetic balance in the human body; the state of natural health known as <span><strong>“homeostasis”.</strong></span> It involves the precise and proper (North/South polarity) placement of special high field strength magnets over very specific areas of the body, to support the regulation of pH in these very areas.  By maintaining adequate pH, homeostasis may be reestablished so that the body may heal itself.  Homeostasis restores normal structure and functions to our immune system, increases circulation and oxygenation, normalizes the body's response to inflammation and many more positive effects on our bodies.  It is believed that pH imbalances throughout our bodies may ultimately accumulate and alter our stable microbiome allowing for the development of health conditions.</p><p>Medical doctor Isaac Goiz Duran discovered this therapy in Mexico City, Mexico in 1988.  Dr. Goiz states that Biomagnetism studies, detects, classifies, measures and allows for the correction of pH imbalances in living organisms.  By reestablishing the natural pH balance of the body, different microorganisms such as virus, fungi, bacteria, and parasites can be kept under control by our renewed homeostasis and natural defenses.  The healing homeostasis process occurs when the pH balance is restored and optimized and it is this which determines the well-being of the person, which before the therapy was altered by the presence of pathogenic microorganisms that distorted the levels of acidity and alkalinity (pH) of the organs.  For example, all fish need water to survive but some need saltwater, whereas others need freshwater and each one of these must be maintained within a specific pH range.  Everyone, who has had an aquarium or pool, knows the importance of pH balance in the water.  We are not that much different than fish because our bodies are made up of over 70% water and we have a very specific pH balance that we need to maintain if we are to remain healthy!  If we reestablish our body’s natural pH balance in our liver, lungs, pancreas, kidneys, muscles, joints, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, etc., then these organs may continue functioning correctly again. The old saying, “You are what you eat” holds true.  If we eat acid-producing foods, then our bodies will shift towards a more acidic pH.  More acidic pH is believed to promote inflammation and chronic degenerative conditions.</p><p>The pH scale goes from 0 to 14, with 7 being neutral. Below 7 is acidic and above 7 is alkaline.  Arterial and venous blood must maintain a slightly alkaline pH: arterial blood pH = 7.41 and venous blood pH = 7.36. Because the normal pH of arterial blood (7.41) arise a variety of approaches based on increasing the alkalinity of the tissues, such as the vegetarian diet, the drinking of fresh fruit and vegetable juices, and dietary supplementation with alkaline minerals to maintain a more stable overall alkaline pH.  Although these strategies help maintain pH, they may not be enough in today’s harsh environment.</p><br><p class='multi-pathogen-image'><img src='/images/biomagnetism-and-magnetic-therapy-are-they-different-therapies-blog-1.png' class='blog-detailsImg-diabetes' style='width: 100%'></p><br><p>Dr. Goiz revealed that it is possible to recover healthy homeostasis metabolic states through the use of bio-magnetic fields of medium intensity, produced by magnets of 1,000 to 4,000 Gauss, applied in pairs in specific parts of the body called Biomagnetic Pairs (BMP).  Not all magnets are alike.  They come in different materials, shapes, sizes, etc.</p><p class='multi-pathogen-image'><img src='/images/biomagnetism-and-magnetic-therapy-are-they-different-therapies-blog-2.png' class='blog-detailsImg-diabetes' style='width: 100%'></p><p>The Gauss of a magnet refers to the magnetic strength properties of a specific magnetic material which is used to compare and rate different magnets.  Each magnet made from the same material will have different gauss readings based on size, weight, and shape.

Magnets are usually rated in terms of the Core Gauss or the Maximum magnetic force at the dead center of a magnet.  This is usually almost 10 times stronger than the surface gauss.  Therefore a magnet with 1,500 surface gauss will have about 14,000 core Gauss.  In order for Biomagnetism to function correctly, magnets of at least 1,000 surface gauss or 11,000 Core gauss or BrMax gauss or N40 or above ratings are desired for optimal use.

Generally, a balanced low carbohydrate diet with the aid of pharmaceutical medication can help stabilize a person’s glucose metabolism.</p><br><p class='multi-pathogen-image'><img src='/images/diabetes-and-biomagnetism-blog-1.jpg'  class='text-md-center text-xs-center blog-detailsImg' style='text-align: center; margin: auto; width: 100%;'></p><br><P>Dr. Isaac Goiz Duran, founder of Biomagnetism states that most of the Diabetes cases are actually caused by the combination of different pathogens or infections including bacteria, virus, fungus and parasites that may cause inflammation to different parts of the pancreas or surrounding tissues.  These infections then interfere with proper glucose and insulin metabolism. He believes that modern medicine has focused too much on the symptoms of disease instead of the underlying causes.  What if the pancreas was indeed producing enough insulin but other metabolic cascades were not working properly because of different infections causing inflammation and therefore, interfering with the normal pancreatic production and metabolism of the insulin further down the line?

                "fullDescription": "<p>Yes, that's right. The deadliest and poorly misunderstood disease Malaria can be addressed with Biomagnetism!  So, you think just because you live in a country that's supposedly free of Malaria you are not at risk?  Wrong.  Not only has global warming contributed to mosquitoes living longer but also flying further and being more infectious than ever!  When in the Northeastern United States, the cold weather would traditionally kill off the mosquitoes in September. But now, with the warmer weather until November, one can still find some mosquitoes hanging around until late October early November which gives them more time to continue to transmit whatever infectious disease they are carrying!  The fact that air travel has also facilitated our travels around the world; everyone no longer needs to travel deep into the heart of the Amazon forest to get bitten by mosquitoes and acquire Malaria.  All it really takes is just a single mosquito bite right in your backyard in rural NJ or wherever you may be. It's not that the mosquito found its way from sub-Saharan Africa or South Asia or South America to NJ, but his parasitic passengers, the parasite species Plasmodium did.</p><p class='multi-pathogen-image'><img src='/images/malaria-and-biomagnetism-blog.png' class='text-md-center text-xs-center blog-detailsImg' style='text-align: center; margin: auto; width: 100%'></p><p>If a person from NJ travels to any one of the equatorial countries thousands of miles north or south of the equator for the summer and is bitten by a Malaria carrying mosquito, this person then returns home from vacation carrying the parasites.  Days or weeks later when a different mosquito bites this same person with Malaria, this mosquito is now able to then transmit it to any new person it bites in the same neighborhood from a range of several hundred feet up to a range of 3 miles away. Given that the lifespan of a female mosquito can be just over 50 days, and the fact that it can bite over 20 other people before it dies, leaving an exponential number of people infected with Malaria or any other mosquito carrying disease.</p><p class='multi-pathogen-image'><img src='/images/malaria-and-biomagnetism-blog-1.png' class='blog-detailsImg' style='width: 100%'></p><p><strong >Symptoms of Malaria</strong></p><p>Typical symptoms include but are not limited to: Chronic fatigue, malaise, fevers, night sweats, hot flashes, stiff neck, painful joints, fibromyalgia symptoms, lethargic, brain fog, flu-like illness, chills, headache, and muscle aches. Some less frequent symptoms can be anemia, jaundice, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.</p><p><strong >How I Healed Myself?</strong> </p><p>On a personal note, I had my first real encounter with Malaria back in July of 2013, when my wife and I traveled to India on vacation.  The day after returning, we fell ill and experienced all the above Malaria symptoms!  We were bedridden for 3 days!  When I finally had the energy and mental clarity to give my wife a Biomagnetism session, I discovered the Malaria pair Cervical vertebrae 3 / Bladder.  I placed this pair along with the others (found in the app when you type in Malaria) and within 20 minutes, she felt a dramatic change.  I then placed all those pairs on myself and experienced an equal dramatic difference.  We have been free of all those Malarial symptoms ever since that fateful day and today I find Biomagnetic Malaria pairs on patients on a weekly basis!  Thank you Biomagnetism!</p><p>Many of the Biomagnetism pairs for Malaria can be found in the Beyond Biomag 3D App.  Give them all a try and observe how you feel afterward.  It’s always a good idea to place the same magnet pairs on yourself once again about 10 to 15 days later just in case.</p><p>For more reading about how Malaria is more common than previously thought and how it helped America win independence, check out these great links!</p><p><a href='https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/24/health/fatal-malaria-united-states.html'>https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/24/health/fatal-malaria-united-states.html</a></p><p><a href='http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/how-lowly-mosquito-helped-america-win-independence-180959411/'>http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/how-lowly-mosquito-helped-america-win-independence-180959411/</a></p><p class='text-xs-right'>Best of health to all.<br><strong>Luis F.

I use this term because, in my personal and careful analysis of hundreds of 'Lyme' clients, I have observed many different pathogens contributing to the varied symptoms that they present.  For example, the most common pathogens that I have observed according to Biomagnetism and Bioenergetic interpretation have been:<br><br><ul class='pathogen-subcontent'><li class='pathogen-list-styles'> Plasmodium species (malaria), Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Yersinia pestis (the Plague), Epstein Barr Virus, Cytomegalovirus, Borrelia burgdorferi (standard Lyme), Dengue, Bartonella, Babesia, Mycoplasma pneumonia, Proteus mirabilis, Candida, Rabies virus and Entamoeba histolytica among others.  Even though I scan with muscle testing for hundreds of pathogens ranging from bacteria, virus, fungi, and parasites among all my clients, these have been the most common amongst 'Lyme' clients.</li><br><li class='pathogen-list-styles'>Not only do they have a combination of these in one session, but over the course of several sessions, the rest of the pathogens begin to appear.  The clients also frequently get re-contaminated with either the same ones such as Plasmodium species (because it's summer and they are bitten by mosquitos and think nothing of it, yet the mosquitos were carrying it) and or Bartonella, Dengue or any one of the many mosquito-borne diseases.</li><br><li class='pathogen-list-styles'>Another frequent recurrence is from pets such as dogs picking up the ticks outside and then passing them on to their household members.  Hence, Lyme is a Multi-Pathogen Syndrome (MPS) that is constantly changing as a result of a weakened immune system.</li></ul><br>How is it that some people were bitten by ticks or mosquitos and nothing happens?  My observation has been that these people have a more balanced lifestyle in terms of less emotional stress, healthier nutritional habits, better sleep, more stable emotions, less toxic body burden, etc.  Overall, those affected by 'Lyme' are at their body's maximum limit for stress in one way or another and their immune system fails them and slowly but surely these different infections either creep in over time, hiding in different organs waiting for the right time to come out and flourish, or they have been there for many years.<br><br>For example, an Epstein Barr viral infection that caused Mononucleosis in their youth and knocked them out for a few weeks then, now in adulthood with stress, resurfaces and knocks them out again but this time in combination with these other co-infections.   In theory, giving antibiotics for some of these bacterial infections should work, but seeing as how it is multi-pathogenic, what of the viral infections?  What if there are multiple bacterial infections at the same time in different organs resistant to the antibiotics?  What of the fungal overgrowth caused by the combination of the weakened immune system and the overuse of antibiotics that knocks out the gut flora?  What about the parasitic infections that go unregulated and overlooked by nearly all Lyme doctors? <br><br>As you can see, 'Lyme Disease' is a multi-factorial disease that must be addressed as holistically as possible.  Does the individual have too much emotional stress other than their illness that is causing an overload on their adrenals and thereby dropping their immune system?  Is the individual toxic with lead, aluminum, mercury, arsenic, cadmium, etc., so that their metabolism and the immune system are compromised physiologically?<br><br>Is the individual eating healthy nutritious foods that will aid the body to recover and produce what it needs to fight off the many infections?  Are they eating a more balanced alkaline diet to help stabilize their body's pH balance? Are they getting enough good quality sleep?<br><br>These and many more questions must be considered in a Lyme disease case and evaluated and addressed accordingly with Biomagnetism and Bioenergetics.<br><br>Many of the Biomagnetism pairs to these pathogens can be found in the&nbsp<span><strong>Beyond Biomag 3D App.</strong></span></a> Best of health to all.</p>",

Dr. Garcia has combined his knowledge from many other Biomagnetism mentors around the world including Dr. Miguel Ojeda, Dr. Salvador Gutierrez Rodriguez de Mondelo, Dr. Enrique de Juan Gonzalez de Castejon, Dr. Mario Ricardo Rodriguez, Jorge Mena PhD, Antonio Salas PhD, Gustavo Guayasamin, Jorge Tapia, Carlos Zamora, and Alejandro Lavin.<br><br>Let us all unite and continue to make this a global phenomenon one relevant Biomagnetic pair at a time.  I welcome your feedback and look forward to meeting you at the seminar.I would like to conclude with a quote that a medical colleague used as well about this therapy being made public.<br><br><strong class='italic-font'>“Science and art belong to the whole world, and the barriers of nationality vanish before them” – Johann Wolfgang von Goethe &nbsp;(1749-1832)</strong><br></p><h4 class='trainingPageHedclr'>Course Content:</h4><ul class='CourseContent'><li>Background of Biomagnetism and basic terms</li><li>Difference between Dr. Goiz Biomagnetism and Magnetic Therapy</li><li>Preventive, diagnostic, and therapeutic system</li><li>Concept of pH in the body</li><li>Biomagnetic Pairs, pathogens, and organ dysfunction</li><li>Electromagnetic fields and their effects on the body</li><li>Electromagnetic Resonance</li><li>Basic concepts in microbiology: Bacteria, Virus, Fungus, Parasites, other</li><li>Synergies between the different pathogenic microorganisms</li><li>Biomagnetic Pairs and disease</li><li>Therapeutic action of magnets</li><li>Types of magnets</li><li>Polarity of magnets</li><li>Warnings about the use of magnets</li><li>Care of magnets</li><li>Poles and scanning biomagnetic points</li><li>Hands-on clinical practice</li><li>Horizontal and vertical pairs</li><li>Kinesiological phenomenon of hemibody shortening</li><li>Types of Biomagnetic Pairs</li><li>Legal precautions</li><li>Important practical details and examples, how to hold the patient's feet, how to avoid errors, etc.</li><li>Tumor Factors</li><li>Healing Crisis</li><li>Precautions after the session</li><li>Duration of biomagnetism treatment</li><li>Problem of re-infection, reservoirs, and personal pairs: solutions</li><li>Golden rules in Biomagnetism</li><li> Cancer, HIV, allergies, asthma, arthritis, diabetes, hypertension, endocrine dysfunctions, hernias, Lyme, Autism and other diseases will be addressed.</li> <li>Bioenergy basics </li><li>Bioenergy basics</li><li>Methodology for exploration with Bioenergy</li></ul><br><img class='hotel-accomadation-img' src='../images/training-therapist.png'><br><br><div class='trainingDetails'><div class='class-schedule-backclr'><h4 class='trainingPageHedclr'>Class Schedule:</h4><ul class='CourseContent'><li>Wednesday, May 22, 2019 | 8:30 am-7:00 pm.</li><li>Thursday May 23 to Sunday May 26, 2019 | 9:00 am-7:00 pm</li><li>Lunch breaks will be from 1:30-3:00 pm (Lunch not included).</li><li>Two daily 30 minutes coffee/snack breaks from 11:00-11:30 am and 5:00-5:30 pm <br>(included during the seminar).</li></ul></div><p><h4 class='trainingPageHedclr'>Lunch Options:</h4> There are over 10 restaurants within a 5-10 minute walk from the hotel.

Biomagnetism is compatible with all other therapies and treatments such as flower essences, Emotional Freedom Technique, hypnotherapy, Neuro Linguistic Programming, psychology, acupuncture, homeopathy, naturopathy, orthomolecular medicine, herbal medicine, etc… Biomagnetism may also be combined with conventional medical and pharmacological treatments.  It may benefit chronic and degenerative conditions. In fact, thousands of allopathic doctors are already using this powerful technique in their medical offices, either publicly or secretly, to complement and enhance their medical treatments.A basic yet minimum knowledge of anatomy and physiology is strongly recommended.  Although there is no prerequisite for this course, students can study these subjects later at their own pace.  The only prerequisite for this course is having an open mind free from prejudice and the desire to learn and help others.</p><p>We recommend that you download and subscribe to our&nbsp;<span class='biomag-blog alignment'>Beyond Biomag 3D App</span></p><div class='col-md-12 training-app-padding'><div class='training-app-buttons'><a href='https://itunes.apple.com/in/app/beyond-biomag-3d/id1161699021?mt=8' target='_blank'><img class='app-button-training' alt='' src='app-store-button.png' width='140px'></a><a href='https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.helensys.biomag&#10;' target='_blank'><img class='app-button-training' alt='' src='android-app-store.png' width='140px'></a></div></div><p class='training-app-contents2'>so that you can learn to use it as a reference tool during the seminar and beyond.</P>",
